# Heart Rate Prediction

This project provides a machine learning solution for predicting heart rate using a dataset of relevant physiological and environmental features. It applies data preprocessing and explores various machine learning models to deliver predictions. The goal is to predict heart rate accurately based on specific input parameters, which could be beneficial for health monitoring and fitness tracking applications.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. The project relies on Python 3.x and requires libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-rate-prediction.git
    cd heart-rate-prediction
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Project Structure
- `HEARTRATE_PREDICTION.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main project code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder for storing the dataset.
- `models/`: Folder for saving trained models and model artifacts.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes features relevant to predicting heart rate, such as physical activity levels, body metrics, and other physiological indicators. The data should be placed in the `data/` folder. Ensure the dataset is clean and preprocessed as per the steps in the notebook.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
1. Handling missing values.
2. Feature scaling and normalization.
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

These steps are essential for ensuring that the model can learn effectively from the data without biases introduced by scale or missing information.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The notebook trains a machine learning model using the processed dataset, potentially experimenting with algorithms like:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

Each model is evaluated for accuracy and other relevant metrics to determine the best-performing model for heart rate prediction.

## Usage
To predict heart rate:
1. Open the `HEARTRATE_PREDICTION.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the steps to load the model and make predictions on new input data.

Alternatively, you can use the exported model in a separate Python script to integrate with other applications.
